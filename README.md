</p>

This game was created for the [Global Game Jam 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/). The theme for this year's jam was "roots". Our idea started out as a growing root dodging and zapping things in the soil, but it morphed into a cute digging bunny eating root veggies.

The game can be downloaded from itch.io at [https://jlothamer.itch.io/boppy-bunnys-rootin-adventure](https://jlothamer.itch.io/boppy-bunnys-rootin-adventure).

## Gameplay

The game is loosely inspired by the video game snake, but minus the part where the snake gets longer and longer the more it eats. This was to increase the challenge.
